# 👋 Hey there, I'm Steven Altsman!  

## 🛠 About Me  
I'm a seasoned developer based in **North Houston, TX**, with a passion for building, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of technology. My journey in programming has taken me through various stacks, but these days, I focus primarily on:  

- **C#** – From backend services to game development, I enjoy working with .NET.  
- **Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)** – Whether it's building APIs, web apps, or automation tools, JavaScript is my playground.  
- **GenAI & Machine Learning** – I'm diving deeper into AI, exploring the latest advancements, and experimenting with models and techniques.  

## 🎨 Art, Music, & Other Obsessions  
Before I got serious about code, I studied at the **Kansas City Art Institute** back in 1996 (though I didn’t stick around past the first year). My love for **music** and **anime** has stayed with me over the years—two things that constantly inspire my creativity.  

## 🎭 Latest Experiment: **ComfyUI**  
Right now, I’m having a blast tinkering with **ComfyUI**, pushing AI-generated art and automation workflows to their limits. If you're into **GenAI, AI-assisted creativity, or just hacking around with AI tools**, let's connect!  

## 🚀 What I'm Into Lately  
- **Web3 & Decentralization** 🌐  
- **Hosting distributed services on Raspberry Pi clusters** 🖥️  
- **Fantasy & Sci-Fi worldbuilding** ✨  
- **Open-source AI tools & frameworks** 🤖
